# California-Housing-Price-Prediction

### Step1: Import all libraries

### Step2: Load the data

Step2.1: Read the “housing.csv” file from the folder into the program

Step2.2: Print first few rows of this data

Step2.3: Extract input (X) and output (y) data from the dataset

### Step3: Handle missing values: Fill the missing values with the mean of the respective column

### Step4: Encode categorical data: Convert categorical column in the dataset to numerical data

### Step5: Split the dataset: Split the data into 80% training dataset and 20% test dataset

### Step6: Standardize data: Standardize training and test datasets



## Task1: Perform Linear Regression

Task1.1: Perform Linear Regression on training data

Task1.2: Predict output for test dataset using the fitted model

Task1.3: Print root mean squared error (RMSE) from Linear Regression




## Task4: Bonus exercise:  Perform Linear Regression with 8 other independent variable

Task4.1: Find the Training error and test error of each of the models created from all the created independent variables.

Task4.2: let us visualize the Training error and the test error
